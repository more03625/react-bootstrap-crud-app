            As of recently, Binance Smart Chain’s elusive PancakeSwap became
            quite popular among DeFi investors, reaching a level where it
            competes against traditional DEX options like Uniswap and SushiSwap.
            Did PancakeSwap rightfully earn its fame and if so, how?
          </p>

            Not an avid reader? That’s fine. You can also learn about
            PancakeSwap in video format!
          </p>

          <p>
            PancakeSwap is a decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, one
            of Ethereum's top competitors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Interestingly enough, the Binance Smart Chain blockchain is the
            creation of Binance, a centralized crypto exchange known for being
            the largest in the world. With PancakeSwap, Binance is essentially
            competing against two distinct cryptocurrency establishments —
            Ethereum and Uniswap.
          </p>

          <p>
            The intrigue gets even deeper because PancakeSwap can outshine
            Binance itself if exchange volume gets deep enough. However,
            cryptocurrency narratives aside, PancakeSwap is one of today's
            largest DeFi protocols, and one that needs explaining if you're new.
          </p>

          <p>
            This guide to PancakeSwap will teach you the basics of how the
            decentralized exchange and liquidity protocol work, along with how
            to use each to your advantage.
          </p>

          <p>
            After all, there are enough differences when you compare Uniswap to
            PancakeSwap that it's well worth understanding PancakeSwap's
            features.
